# OnePlayer
 My First Android Studio Project and My First Repo
 Contains a basic video player made using android studio and Google's Open source ExoPlayer framework
 It plays a video file from a link (hardcoded in activity file)
 Also it has some theme changing options and a fake "hardware acceleration" toast :)
 Enjoy!
